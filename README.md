This project is intended for a specific use related to the tools used at [Bertin IT](https://www.bertin-it.com/). It allows to make a bridge between [Taiga](https://taiga.io/) and [Squash TM](https://www.squashtest.org/fr). For these reason, some part of the code is not so generic. But don't worry for that, if you have specific needs, if you want to participate, if you want to give your ideas you are more than welcome.

Just let me know about it and create issues, i will check them and answer you.
